version:
0.00.01	first version.finished by Jesson.

Compile:

please read config.cfg at the next higher level first,choose your chip'type that you used.
if not found,you need add the type ourself,the same as the sample.
then,execute Makefile command as make liba or make liba CHIP=HI3518(your chip type).

Module usage:

instruction:this gpio module is a application with gpio,we provided some interfaces as follow.
==================================================
int GPIO_Open(char *devName);
description:
you can use this interface to open the system'gpio device,we operate the gpio'interface must execute it.
	devName:it is generated with the gpio driver.

return value£º
	vlaue that Greater than zero is returned indicate SUCCESS and this value is handle,other is failed.errno can use follow interface CLOCK_Get_Error to get.

==================================================
int GPIO_Close(int handle);
description:
you can use this interface to close gpio's device file,usually when power down or reset this interface is used.
	handle:the value is returnd when open the gpio.

return value£º
	the same as above.

==================================================
int GPIO_Set_Dir(int gpio_group,int gpio_bit,int value);
description:
you can use this interface to set system gpio is input or output.
	gpio_group:the value is gpio's group.
	gpio_bit:the value is gpio's bit.
	value:the value is gpio's direction,0 is input,1 is output.
	
return value£º
	the same as above.
	
==================================================
int GPIO_Set_Value(int gpio_group,int gpio_bit,int value)
description:
you can use this interface to set system a gpio's bit is low or high.
	gpio_group:the value is gpio's group.
	gpio_bit:the value is gpio's bit.
	value:the value is output state(low or high).
	
return value£º
	the same as above.
	
==================================================
int GPIO_Get_Value(int gpio_group,int gpio_bit);
description:
you can use this interface to get a gpio bit's state.
	gpio_group:the value is gpio's group.
	gpio_bit:the value is gpio's bit.
	
return value£º
	the value is the io'state(low or high).
	
==================================================
int GPIO_Control(int gpio_group,int gpio_bit,e_gpio_control enCtrl,int ms_value,int isHigh);
you can use this interface to set a io.
	gpio_group:the value is gpio's group.
	gpio_bit:the value is gpio's bit.
	enCtrl:include disposable operation¡¢aperiodic operation
	ms_value:the value is duration in disposable operation, or the value is a period in aperiodic operation
	isHigh:set the io current state.
	
return value£º
	the same as GPIO_Open.
