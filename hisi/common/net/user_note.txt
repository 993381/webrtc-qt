version:
0.00.01	first version.finished by Jesson.

Compile:

please read config.cfg at the next higher level first,choose your chip'type that you used.
if not found,you need add the type ourself,the same as the sample.
then,execute Makefile command as make liba or make liba CHIP=HI3518A(your chip type).

Module usage:

instruction:this clock module is a application with pcf8563,hisilicon'hirtc and ntp just time,we provided some interfaces as follow.
==================================================
int CLOCK_Open(e_clock_type enType);
description:
you can use this interface to run a clock,the same time system'clock changed with hardware'clock.
	enType:include CLOCK_TYPE_HIRTC,CLOCK_TYPE_PCF8563 and CLOCK_TYPE_NTP,please read the part of CLOCK in common_define.h.

return value£º
	vlaue that Greater than zero is returned indicate SUCCESS and this value is handle,other is failed.errno can use follow interface CLOCK_Get_Error to get.
	#define CLOCK_ALREADY_USED	-1
	#define CLOCK_OPEN_FAILD	-2
	#define CLOCK_NONE_EXIST	-3

==================================================
int CLOCK_Close(int handle);
description:
you can use this interface to stop a clock,usually when power down or reset this interface is used.
	handle:the value is returnd when open the clock.

return value£º
	the same as above.

==================================================
int CLOCK_Get(int handle,st_clock_t *);
description:
you can use this interface to get system time of current.
	handle:the value is returnd when open the clock.
	st_clock_t:struct is year month day hour minute second week.year is 20XX.
	
return value£º
	the same as above.
	
==================================================
int CLOCK_Set(int handle,st_clock_t *);
you can use this interface to set system time,the same time time is written to the clock chip.
	handle:the value is returnd when open the clock.
	st_clock_t:struct is year month day hour minute second week.year is 20XX.
	
return value£º
	the same as above.

==================================================
int CLOCK_Get_Error(int handle);
you can use this interface to get the error that above interface generate.
	handle:the value is returnd when open the clock.
	
return value£º
	the same as above.

==================================================
int CLOCK_Version(void);										//1.00.00=0x10000  0.00.01=0x000001
you can use this interface to get the clock module, version.
	
return value£º
	the version with integer.V1.00.00=0x10000  V0.00.01=0x000001

ATTENTION:
    the ntp module only get time from internet at open. it can not be set.
